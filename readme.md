This Twitter bot uses [ImageSharp](https://sixlabors.com) to generate
a custom image of [Dr. Manhattan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Manhattan) sitting on
Mars being Tired of... well anything.

It listens for mentions at [@TiredManhattan](https://twitter.com/TiredManhattan) for text and generates a custom image. You
can also call an endpoint (`/image?text=`) to generate an image locally. Finally, you
can have the bot tweet by calling `/tweet?text=`. That said, only I, [@buhakmeh](https://twitter.com/buhakmeh)
have the credentials, so you'll have to make your own bot :)

That said, this is a great starting point if you're building a Twitter bot to respond
to folks on Twitter.
